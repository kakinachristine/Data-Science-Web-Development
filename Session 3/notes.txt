# This is a diabetes dataset
# Input different elements/values then based on them then we predict if user is diabetic or not after training the model


# Have requirements.txt file that will store all our imports the load this file using pip install-r fileName.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt- installs all the packages from requirements file)
# Train and save the ML model: pandas(data handling), scikit-learn9 for ML model) and joblib(saving the model)
# create a python file to train the model
# Create web app on streamlit
# Then you can make prediction on values if user is diabetic or not

# To run my app in python is "python appName.py"
